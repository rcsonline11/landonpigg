        moved to Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, and he and two of his
        siblings, Cari-Ann and Gabriel, sang commercial jingles with their
        father's direction. They all attended Grace Lutheran School in River
        Forest, Illinois. He returned to Nashville as a teenager. where he
        attended high school at the Christ Presbyterian Academy. During Pigg's
        adolescence, his father offered him informal music education and
        encouraged his curiosity with music. He also credits his mother for
        nourishing his poetic side.
